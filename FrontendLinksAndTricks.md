# Overall frontend web development guidelines

    Here is the basic gist:
        1. Learn HTML & CSS. These do not work separately these days. They are like spoon and a plate. You start with HTML.
        2. Learn JavaScript(JS). Now your plate and spoon have some soup to eat
        3. Learn a JS framework like React, Vue, Angular or Svelte. React has the most jobs so I recommend React.
        4. Make few projects for your portfolio. 
        5. Use your portfolio to make a good impression during interviews 
        6. ................
        7. PROFIT!

    Given our schedude all this can be accomplished in a year. If you do it day in and day out - probably in less than 6 mths.

    Here is a less basic gist: https://roadmap.sh/frontend #this may look dramatically long but don't let this discourage you. What shown is the way to become a senior.

# Tools of trade

    You can write sites in Notepad but this is not a good idea. There are specialized tools (IDE) for coders like Sublime, Atom, VIM, VSCode, JetBrains WebStorm, and so on. I use VSCode - it is free and has so many extensions that it almost can compete with paid monsters like WebStorm.

    1. https://code.visualstudio.com/ 

    2. Use https://codepen.io/pen/ #if want to code while away from home PC or just do something quick 

    3. Firefox or Chrome browsers. Both have powerful developer tools. I recommend having both.

    4. https://github.com/ #repository for projects as well as a social network for developers in some sense.

    5. Why you are not on linkedin yet? 


# Websites that guide and help

    1. https://2ch.hk/pr/ #self explanatory. There is a JavaScript thread that regularly reach bump limit

    2. https://github.com/acilsd/wrk-fet #The mother of all guidelines. 

    3. https://stackoverflow.com/ #basically a platform for answers. Masses of wisdom and knowledge from other coders. 

# Websites that teach

    1. https://www.freecodecamp.org/ #if watching YT does not fit your fancy then this one is a good one for starters. Covers a lot but unfortunately skips deep knowledge leaving you with basics while not letting you know that what you've learned only covers basics. 

    2. https://stepik.org/catalog #Boundless with tons of them free.

    3. https://htmlacademy.ru/courses #awesome resource but not free except the first few lessons. Has the same idea as #1 - interactive lessons. Not required but I can't recommend it enough! It is really well made and makes learning a breeze. Would run you 62 BYN for 3 months wich is plenty for getting through during your days off.

    4. https://www.codecademy.com/learn #the same idea as previous but more expensive and has more languages.

    5. https://scrimba.com/pricing #massively awesome free courses but even better paid courses. Don't pay until you are at good level already.

    6. https://www.pirple.com/ #this one is odd - everything is for pay and is expensive but it has a bundle pack for $97 for all courses. I'm not sure if worthy bcz only few courses are related to webdevelopment
